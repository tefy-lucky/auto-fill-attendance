## What the hell is this script?
Since the spread of COVID-19 in our country, the managers have decided it's best to work from home.
In order to check that everyone is there doing their job, they created a spreadsheets to check every
day to show we are indeed "online" and doing our work. This script automates the check-in of me and my girlfriend
everyday at 8am.

## Why did I create this script?
OK, so first of all I'm a lazy man, yeah. If I can automate a boring and tiring task, 
I'll find a way to do it using my ~~very good~~ programming skills :sweat_smile:.
